need to determine how to load gapi into spreadsheetHelper.js, require?
ask sawyer if it's possible to load gapi from a url directly into javascript instead of having to go through html
otherwise, ask plausibility for passing gapi through the html script load, to a wrapper function that passes it eventually into spreadsheethelper.js

scratch last two, but error with 'window' in the googleAPI.js file downloaded
attempted npm install of gapi that needed coffeescript dependency, but apparently require('gapi') (that's what they said to use on the website) returns an undefined object somehow



later:
consider error output in the event of mismatched types(date, int) (error code 500? pretty sure)
probably get rid of that date shit and automatically call date to store upon request submission
